# Mental Health Tracker - Mood Analytics and Journal Visualization

## Features

- **Mood Analytics**: Displays the average mood, best day (highest mood), and worst day (lowest mood).
- **Mood Trend Visualization**: A line chart shows mood trends over time.
- **Word Cloud**: A dynamic word cloud generated from the journal entries, showing the most common words.
